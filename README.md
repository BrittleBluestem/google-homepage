Project Goal: Build an HTML/CSS clone of the google homepage.

Reflection: Project complete. Homepage looks good, some small differences in css between googl and myself. Moral of the story is that the inspect tool is super powerful. Google has many shorhand glasses made up to organize code. I just made classes and ids that were usable for myself.
